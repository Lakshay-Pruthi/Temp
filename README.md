# Sandesha

Sandesha is a decentralized, blockchain-based text messaging app built with ReactJS, web3JS, Metamask API, Truffle, and Ganache. It allows users to communicate privately and securely with each other, without the need for a central authority or intermediary. All messages are encrypted and stored securely on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and immutable.

## Getting Started

### Development

To get started with Sandesha, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

You will also need to have Truffle and Ganache installed on your machine to deploy the smart contracts. You can download Truffle from the official website: https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle and Ganache from the official website: https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache.
